# CHANGELOG

## 7.0.0

* Update build process to use a single module, reducing size a bit in
  the process
* Change the way touch detection occurs such that it waits for a valid
  touch event on the window. Removed the `hasTouch` property, which
  shouldn't be necessary (we can add it back if we get requests).

## 6.3.0

* Replace legacy string refs
* Allow className to be overriden

## 6.2.0

* Remove PropTypes and createClass usage to prevent deprecation
  warnings with React 15.5.x

## 6.1.1

* Fix case where ink would hang when switching windows. [Thanks @hhaidar](https://github.com/vigetlabs/react-ink/pull/30)

## v6.1.0

* Add TypeScript definitions

## v6.0.1

* Removed some dependencies that should not have been included in production

## v6.0.0

## v5.1.1

* Use inline source-map to avoid warnings with including external map.

## v5.1.0

* Moved babel compilation configuration from package.json into webpack
  config to avoid cross-project babel compilation issues

  it.
